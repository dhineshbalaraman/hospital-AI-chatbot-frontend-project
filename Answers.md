1. What are the benefits of using private subnets for backend services?
- They enhance security by ensuring that resources within the subnet are not directly accessible from the internet, significantly reducing their exposure to potential attacks.
- Private subnets allow for controlled communication; only essential and permitted traffic can reach the backend services, typically routed through secure components like load balancers or NAT gateways.
- Private subnets support compliance with industry standards by isolating backend systems, which is especially important when handling sensitive data such as patient information in healthcare environments.
2. Why did you choose a NAT Gateway instead of a NAT Instance?

NAT Gateways were chosen over NAT Instances for their reliability, scalability, and ease of use. As a fully managed service, they offer high availability within an Availability Zone and automatically scale to handle varying traffic loads. Unlike NAT Instances, they require no manual maintenance or patching and provide superior network performance and bandwidth, making them ideal for production environments.

3. How would you scale this setup to handle production traffic?
- To scale this setup for handling production traffic, the single EC2 instance can be replaced with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), allowing multiple instances to automatically launch or terminate based on real-time demand. Placing an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of these instances ensures that incoming traffic is distributed evenly, improving both performance and reliability.
- Additionally, integrating Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network can help cache and distribute content globally, significantly reducing the load on the backend servers and improving response times for users.
4. How would you ensure high availability and fault tolerance?

To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, I would design the architecture to distribute workloads across multiple Availability Zones, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. Application servers would be deployed using Auto Scaling Groups, allowing the system to automatically replace unhealthy instances and scale based on demand. An Elastic Load Balancer would be used to intelligently route traffic to healthy targets and balance loads efficiently. For data resilience, I would implement regular automated backups, enable Multi-AZ configurations for databases, and establish tested recovery procedures. Additionally, using infrastructure as code would ensure the environment can be rebuilt quickly and consistently in the event of a failure, further improving the system’s overall resilience

5. What steps would you take to improve security further?
- Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to IAM roles and security groups.
- Enable VPC Flow Logs to monitor and analyze traffic.
- Deploy AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) in front of the Load Balancer.
- Use SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt all communications.
- Regularly perform security audits and enable CloudTrail for auditing AWS API calls.
- Set up automatic security updates on instances.
- Rotate access keys and credentials periodically.
